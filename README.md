# PG12032D Display driver library for Arduino

This repo contains a simple library that has all necessary methods to interact with any of the PG12032D series displays from Powertip.

The documentation for each library function is over the source and as a rendered markdown file in the [docs](docs/API.md) folder.
The documentation for the display, its used chip and its protocol can be found in the [docs/datasheet](docs/datasheets//README.md) folder.
